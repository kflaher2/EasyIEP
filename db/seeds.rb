# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Student.destroy_all


# s1 = Student.new
# s1.name = "Kevin"
# s1.math = "calcualtor"
# s1.save

# s2 = Student.new
# s2.name = "Kevin"
# s2.math = "calcualtor"
# s2.save


# t1 = Teacher.new
# t1.name = "Arjun"
# t1.save

# e1 = Enrollment.new
# e1.teacher_id = t1.id
# e1.student_id = s1.id

# e2 = Enrollment.new
# e2.teacher_id = t1.id
# e2.student_id = s2.id
